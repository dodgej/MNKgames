%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
$M$-$N$-$K$ games are those that are played on a board of size $M$ by $N$ and won by forming a sequence of length $K$.
Such games include the likes of connect-4 or tic-tac-toe, and for smaller boards, winning tactics are well established.
However, as the board and sequence for winning grows larger, it becomes more complicated to determine a strategy that will lead to victory.
This paper looks at how deep reinforcement learning can be applied to effectively select moves in the large action space of $M$-$N$-$K$ games.
