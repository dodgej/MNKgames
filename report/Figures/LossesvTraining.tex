	\caption{Loss count vs training sessions.
    Note that loss count drops initially, then rises again.
    Particularly, note how sharply the loss count rises as the training session approaches 28.
    We found that with these training sessions, win rate (and illegal moves) really went haywire around training session 28, which indicates noise in the gradient.
   	As described earlier, minibatch-based training is likely the best remedy for this behavior.}
